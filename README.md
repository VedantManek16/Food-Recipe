## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The app initially loads meals from a **default cuisine** (e.g., Indian).  
2. Clicking on different **cuisine buttons** fetches meals of that type.  
3. Typing a keyword in the **search bar** and pressing Enter fetches matching recipes.  
4. Hovering over a **meal image** shows a clickable overlay link to open the recipe in a new tab.
